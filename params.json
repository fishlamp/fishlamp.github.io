{"name":"Fishlamp.github.io","tagline":"organization webpage","body":"### Welcome to the FishLamp homepage.\r\n\r\nFishLamp is a collection of small collections of code I call pieces - these pieces are meant to be aggregated together into your project. Each piece is meant to solve a specific problem or implement a specific feature. FishLamp is not meant to be monolithic. \r\n\r\nYou consume and use these pieces using the awesome [CococPods](http://cocoapods.org) tools. (Note, I'm still working on wiring everything up to cocoapods, so we're not quite fully integrated yet).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pieces\r\n\r\nThe pieces are arranged like this:\r\n\r\n[fishlamp-objc](http://github.com/fishlamp-objc)\r\n\r\nThese are the core pieces in objective-c that work on either iOS or OSX.\r\n\r\n[fishlamp-osx](http://github.com/fishlamp-osx)\r\n\r\nThese are the pieces specifically for OSX.\r\n\r\n[fishlamp-osx](http://github.com/fishlamp-osx)\r\n\r\nThese are the pieces specifically for iOS.\r\n\r\n### Getting the code\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMy name is (Mike Fullerton)[http://www.mikefullerton.com]. I've been working on FishLamp for a number of years now and am working toward the first fully open sourced release.
