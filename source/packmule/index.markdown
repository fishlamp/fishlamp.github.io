PackMule is a Mac OS X developer tool (a document based Cocoa app) which generates objective-c code from XML, JSON, or WSDL input. This generated code is integrated with FishLamp’s Model Object abstraction which provides caching, streaming, and other framework features. 

PackMule automates the lengthy and tedious task of abstracting data models, primarily those published by third party web-services or an app specific data model. 

[Whittle](whittle.html) is the command line version of PackMule’s code generator, which allows for flexible automation.

For a bit more information, please see the whittle page.
Here’s a screen shot of PackMule editing the FaceBook FishLamp project file.
