I love writing code, but I hate solving the same problem more than once. I passionately revile it. Maybe more so than I should.

I strive for a few things when I write code. I try to solve the problem once. I try to help the future me re-solve the same problem.

All programmers solve problems. Few think about how they will solve that same problem the next time. And a tiny minority (in my experience) write the code to be reused from the moment the fingers hit the keyboard.

For some, this is a controversial way to do things, but it's the way I work and I've been writing code this way for over twenty years. It just is.

Writing code this way <em>does</em> make things a bit harder, at least at <em>first</em>. Writing truly reusable code is damn hard, it takes a long time to get good at it. I view it as a craft or an art form. It takes creativity and, well, obsessiveness. I learn something new every day, and I <em>love </em>that<em>. </em>

I've found that it can be very difficult to explain what it is that I'm doing while I'm doing it - visibility into it is sometimes problematic. Even other programmers sometimes don't quite understand this approach, or why I'm doing it. For example, when I was a Microsoft, I once got in trouble for renaming files and classes too often (from a senior development lead). That was a moment of complete and utter confusion for me. Renaming is a byproduct of iterating on an abstraction. Isn't this obvious to everyone?

Um, no. It's not.
