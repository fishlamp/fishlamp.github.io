<p>Writing complex software on iOS is damn freaking backbreakingly hard. Anyone who says differently hasn't done it before. And I'm not talking about fart apps. I'm talking about apps dealing with web services and apps with complex and difficult problems that have to be solved to even make the app useable on a limited device like an iPhone - caching, networking, perceived vs. real performance, all that stuff. Even simple apps can be very time consuming and difficult to get <em>just</em> right.</p>
<p>When I started writing iOS apps, I just wanted to make apps. I was in <em>love </em>with the iPhone. As I wrote and learned and struggled, and as I wrote the apps I was shocked at how hard it could be (and I still am some days.)</p>
<p>Anyway, especially when I have to solve a tough problem, I really, really, REALLY, only want to solve it once. So I tried to do just that and I stuck the solutions to these problems into a folder containing code I could reuse again. </p>
<p>This folder grew and grew and became a gargantuan city stomping monster. But a folder of code is not a framework. But I was treating it like one. I was talking it with people and clients and I realized I had something significant. I began treating it as an entity worthing of attention and care, and I named it FishLamp. I began to craft it into a framework. And that was a couple years ago. </p>
<p>Now I believe that I have something very special and perhaps unique. I want to help other developers ship awesomeness. I want to help other developers solve problems specific to their app, not the same old problems we're all solving over and over again in parallel.</p>
<p>I will share FishLamp with you. I'm still figuring out how to do this though. There's a lot of tough problems to solve do this <em>correctly</em>.</p>
<p>And then there's the tools. PackMule, Whittle, and Fluffy. </p>
<p>More later.</p>
