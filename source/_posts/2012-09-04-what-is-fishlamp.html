<p>FishLamp is an SDK for building apps. Right we support iOS and Mac, but we will go where the action is.</p>
<p>There are two parts to FishLamp, the tools and the framework.</p>
<p>The framework is written in Objective-C. Its a very large (approaching 1500 files now) that has been in development for over three years.</p>
<p>And, yes, it has <span style="font-style: italic;">already</span> shipped in multiple products, multiple times.</p>
<p>More on the tools later.</p>
<p>The code can be found at <a href="http://code.fishlamp.com">code.fishlamp.com</a>. Note - we haven't released the code yet, but we're working on it.</p>
